# webhook-api
A PHP webhook-api I'm working on to streamline my processes. Head to the [wiki](https://github.com/jakobjohansson/webhook-api/wiki) for a detailed documentation of how to use the API.

## Disclaimer
This is a purely hobbyist project and is in no way a claim to be the most efficient or smartest way to handle webhooks.

## Ideas, to-do's
- Option to log every incoming request.
