# webhook-api
A PHP webhook-api I'm working on to streamline my processes.

## Disclaimer
This is a purely hobbyist project and is in no way a claim to be the most efficient or smartest way to handle webhooks.

## Ideas
- Set authorization key (secret).
- Set desired events to keep track of.
- Option to set callback functions for specific events or in general, or a callback URL containing a script.
