# webhook-api
A PHP webhook-api I'm working on to streamline my processes.

## Disclaimer
This is a purely hobbyist project and is in no way a claim to be the most efficient or smartest way to handle webhooks.
The project is still in its very early development phase, so a lot of functionality is missing. There will be a 0.1 release soon, when the GitHub service and documentation is finished.

## Ideas, to-do's
- Option to log every incoming request.
- Split GitHub into Events and Hook and remove prefixes

Go to the [docs](docs/index.md) for more information.
